# Deflecto
A Brick Breaker game, coded with Java.

### Purpose
- Deflect the ball with the paddle to prevent it from falling out.
- Clear the level by destroying all bricks.

### How to Play
- Use Left Arrow Key <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/6040/6040235.png" width="16" height="16" /> to move the paddle Left.
- Use Right Arrow Key <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/6040/6040240.png" width="16" height="16" /> to move the paddle Right.
- Deflecting ball with right side of the paddle adds 1 unit to the velocity of the ball in positive x direction.
- Deflecting ball with left side of the paddle adds 1 unit to the velocity of the ball in negative x direction.
- Deflecting ball with middle of the paddle retains the x component of the velocity of the ball.

### Auto Save
Deflecto saves your stats every time you complete a level. So that you can always continue from where you left off without losing progress.
